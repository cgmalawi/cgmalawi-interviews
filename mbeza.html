    Mbeza: I did a design internship in 2010 but my first professional job was in 2011, a year before I graduated. They even offered me a better deal than I was asking for. Felt very exciting & it was unbelievable. I was finally making a living out of what I love to do.

    <div class="answer">
    Mbeza: Well am currently working for an Agency in Blantyre and working on big brands in the country. As for business, contrary to popular believe I would like to concentrate on creative businesses that are complemented by my Design skills and not limit myself to starting a design company to join the advertising market in the country but don't worry some day I will.

    Mbeza: I learnt the basics in early 2010 but since then I learnt most of what i know on the job and freelance. As Richard Bradson says, when someone gives you an opportunity to work one something, say yes, even though you don't know much then learn on the job.
